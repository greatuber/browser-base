# Wexond
`Wexond` is an extensible, fast and innovative web browser written in ES2017 using [`Electron`](https://github.com/electron/electron), [`React`](https://reactjs.org/) to build browser's UI easier, and [`MobX`](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx) to easily manage states.

## Documentation
Guides and the API reference are located in [`docs`](https://github.com/Nersent/Wexond/docs).
It also contains documents describing how to use the browser, and create extensions.
